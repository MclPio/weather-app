# weather-app

## Todos:

- toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius
- change the look of the page based on the data
  - maybe by changing the color of the background or by adding images that describe the weather. (You could even use the Giphy API to find appropriate weather-related gifs and display them)
- Handle failed API requests (bulma css loading bar keeps going in some cases)
